# Fish Shell Version - Work In Progress

**Status: Work In Progress** - The fish version is under active development and not yet feature-complete.

## Current Implementation

The fish version includes several specialized reporter scripts:

- `investigate.fish` - Main investigation tool (WIP)
- `fish_abbreviation_reporter.fish` - Reports on fish abbreviations
- `fish_command_reporter.fish` - Analyzes commands in fish context
- `fish_function_reporter.fish` - Function inspection and reporting
- `fish_variable_reporter.fish` - Variable analysis

## Known Limitations

- Not all features from the bash version are implemented yet
- Box-drawing and formatting may differ from bash version
- Some edge cases may not be handled

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the fish version are welcome! The goal is to achieve feature parity with the bash version while respecting fish's syntax and conventions.
