# Zsh Version - Planned

**Status: Planned** - The zsh version is not yet implemented.

## Planned Features

The zsh port will aim to provide similar functionality to the bash version:

- Smart command analysis
- Beautiful box-drawing output
- Symlink following
- Function source discovery
- Syntax highlighting integration
- Flexible display options

## Contributing

Contributions for the zsh implementation are very welcome! If you're interested in developing a zsh version, please:

1. Review the bash implementation in `investigate.sh`
2. Check the fish version for cross-shell patterns
3. Open an issue to discuss your approach
4. Submit a pull request with your implementation

The goal is to achieve feature parity while respecting zsh's unique features and conventions.
